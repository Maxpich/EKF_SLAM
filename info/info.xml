        <briefdescription>
	EKFmonocularSLAM contains Matlab code for EKF SLAM from a 6 DOF motion monocular image sequence. The algorithm takes as input a monocular image sequence and its camera calibration and outputs the estimated camera motion and a sparse map of salient point features. The code includes state-of-the-art contributions to EKF SLAM from a monocular camera: inverse depth parametrization for 3D points and efficient 1-point RANSAC for spurious rejection.

        <description>
        This code contains a complete EKF SLAM system from a monocular sequence, taking as input a sequence from a monocular camera and estimating the 6 DOF camera motion and a sparse 3D map of salient point features. The key contributions in this code are two:

1) INVERSE DEPTH POINT PARAMETRIZATION. This point model suits the projective nature of the camera sensor, allowing to code in the SLAM map very distant points naturally captured by a camera. It is also able to code infinite depth uncertainty, allowing undelayed initialization of point features from the first frame they were seen. At any step, the measurement equation shows the high degree of linearity demanded by the EKF.

2) 1-POINT RANSAC. Robust data association has proven to be a key issue in any SLAM algorithm. 1-Point RANSAC is an algorithm based on traditional random sampling but adapted to the EKF. Specifically, it exploits probabilistic information from the EKF to greatly improve the efficiency over standard RANSAC.
